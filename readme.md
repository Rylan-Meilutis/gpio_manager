# Python GPIO Library

## Installation

``` bash
pip install --break-system-packages --upgrade gpio-manager
``` 

## Usage
### GPIO

- To use, you first need to create a `GPIOManager` object, which can be done by calling:

  ```python
  manager = gpio_manager.GPIOManager()
  ```

- To set up a pin as input with the pull-up resistor enabled on the pin:

  ```python
  manager.add_input_pin(BUTTON_PIN, gpio_manager.InternPullResistorState.AUTO, gpio_manager.LogicLevel.HIGH)
  ```

- To set up a pin as an output pin, run:

  ```python
  manager.add_output_pin(LED_PIN)
  ```

- To set an output pin to the low state, run:

  ```python
  manager.set_output_pin(LED_PIN, gpio_manager.OPinState.LOW)
  ```

- To assign a callback to an input pin for a falling edge trigger:

  ```python
  manager.assign_callback(BUTTON_PIN, gpio_manager.TriggerEdge.FALLING, button_callback)
  ```

- To wait for an edge on an input pin:

  ```python
  manager.wait_for_edge(BUTTON_PIN, gpio_manager.TriggerEdge.FALLING)
  ```

- To set up PWM on an output pin:

  ```python
  manager.setup_pwm(PWM_PIN, FREQUENCY, PULSE_WIDTH, gpio_manager.LogicLevel.HIGH)
  ```

  **Note**: If the pin is already set up as an output, the values for the logic level and current state will be preserved.


- To set the duty cycle of a PWM pin:

  ```python
  manager.set_pwm_duty_cycle(PWM_PIN, DUTY_CYCLE)
  ```

- To set the frequency of a PWM pin:

  ```python
  manager.set_pwm_frequency(PWM_PIN, FREQUENCY)
  ```

- To start the PWM:

  ```python
  manager.start_pwm(PWM_PIN)
  ```

- To stop the PWM:

  ```python
  manager.stop_pwm(PWM_PIN)
  ```

- To reset a pin to its default state:

  ```python
  manager.reset_pin(PIN)
  ```

- To set all output pins to low and clear all interrupts:

  ```python
  manager.cleanup()
  ```
---

### PWM

- To use PWM functionality, you need to create a `PWMManager` object:

  ```python
  pwm_manager = gpio_manager.PWMManager()
  ```

- To set up a PWM channel:

  ```python
  pwm_manager.setup_pwm_channel(CHANNEL_NUM, frequency_hz=1000.0, duty_cycle=50, polarity=pwm_manager.PWMPolarity.NORMAL)
  ```

  - `CHANNEL_NUM`: The PWM channel number (either 0 or 1).
  - `frequency_hz`: The frequency of the PWM signal in Hertz.
  - `duty_cycle`: The duty cycle of the PWM signal as a percentage (from 0 to 100).
  - `polarity`: The polarity of the PWM signal (can be set to `PWMPolarity.NORMAL` or `PWMPolarity.INVERSE`).

- To start the PWM signal on a specified channel:

  ```python
  pwm_manager.start_pwm_channel(CHANNEL_NUM)
  ```

- To stop the PWM signal on a specified channel:

  ```python
  pwm_manager.stop_pwm_channel(CHANNEL_NUM)
  ```

- To remove a PWM channel:

  ```python
  pwm_manager.remove_pwm_channel(CHANNEL_NUM)
  ```

- To set the duty cycle for a PWM channel:

  ```python
  pwm_manager.set_duty_cycle(CHANNEL_NUM, duty_cycle=75)
  ```

  - `CHANNEL_NUM`: The PWM channel number (either 0 or 1).
  - `duty_cycle`: The new duty cycle (from 0 to 100).

- To set the frequency for a PWM channel:

  ```python
  pwm_manager.set_frequency(CHANNEL_NUM, frequency_hz=500.0)
  ```

  - `CHANNEL_NUM`: The PWM channel number (either 0 or 1).
  - `frequency_hz`: The frequency of the PWM signal in Hertz.

- To get the current frequency of a PWM channel:

  ```python
  frequency = pwm_manager.get_frequency(CHANNEL_NUM)
  ```

- To get the current duty cycle of a PWM channel:

  ```python
  duty_cycle = pwm_manager.get_duty_cycle(CHANNEL_NUM)
  ```

### I2C

- To use I2C functionality, you first need to create an `I2CManager` object:

  ```python
  i2c_manager = gpio_manager.I2CManager()
  ```

- To open the I2C bus:

  ```python
   i2c_manager.open(bus=1)
   ```
  - `bus`: The I2C bus number to open (default is 1).

- To close the I2C bus:

  ```python
   i2c_manager.close()
   ```
- To write a single byte to an I2C slave device:

  ```python
   i2c_manager.write_byte(0x20, 0x01, 0xFF)
   ```
  - `0x20`: The I2C slave address.
  - `0x01`: The command to send to the slave device.
  - `0xFF`: The byte to write.

- To read a single byte from an I2C slave device:

  ```python
   data = i2c_manager.read_byte(0x20, 0x01)
   ```
  - `0x20`: The I2C slave address.
  - `0x01`: The command to send to the slave device before reading.
  - `data`: The byte read.

- To write data to an I2C slave device:

  ```python
   i2c_manager.write(0x20, 0x01, b'\x01\x02\x03')
   ```
  - `0x20`: The I2C slave address.
  - `0x01`: The command to send to the slave device.
  - `b'\x01\x02\x03'`: The bytes to write.

- To read data from an I2C slave device:

  ```python
   data = i2c_manager.read(0x20, 0x01, 3)
  ```
  - `0x20`: The I2C slave address.
  - `0x01`: The command to send to the slave device before reading.
  - `3`: The number of bytes to read.
  - `data`: The bytes read.

- To perform a write followed by a read operation:

   ```python
   data = i2c_manager.write_read(0x20, 0x01, b'\x01\x02', 3)
   ```
  - `0x20`: The I2C slave address.
  - `0x01`: The command to send to the slave device.
  - `b'\x01\x02'`: The bytes to write.
  - `3`: The number of bytes to read.
  - `data`: The bytes read.

## Description

- These are rust binding around
  the [RPPAL - Raspberry Pi Peripheral Access Library](https://github.com/golemparts/rppal) crate that gives access to
  gpio, pwm, spi, and more.
  As of current, the only provided bindings are for the gpio library.
  Support for the other functions may come later on.
- These bindings allow you to call the rust code from python in a way that looks like any other python object

## Features

- Able to make multiple objects that can call the gpio without generating errors
- Support for event driven io using callbacks

## Warranty

- This library is provided as is and is not guaranteed to work in all cases.

## Support

- If you have any issues with the library please contact me in class or via the discussion board on brightspace.

## Coming Soon

- Support for UART
- support for SPI
- Support for hardware PWM
- Support for I2C
- Documentation on readthedocs.io
